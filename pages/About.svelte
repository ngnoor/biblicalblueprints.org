	Professionally, he serves as Professor of Ethics at Whitefield Theological Seminary, is a board member for the Pickering Foundation of Biblical Preservation, and has lectured at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. He carefully defended Biblical inerrancy in his book, <em>The Canon of Scripture: A Presuppositional Study</em>, and has written over a dozen other books dealing with difficult theological subjects. Many of these works are being translated into foreign languages to equip the worldwide church.
